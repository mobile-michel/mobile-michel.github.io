[Classless CSS frameworks](https://github.com/topics/classless-css?l=html) are a great option for developers looking to create simple and fast-loading web pages without sacrificing design and style. They are also ideal for small projects or prototypes where the overhead of a full CSS framework may not be necessary.

It's a CSS stylesheet that styles DOM elements based on semantic HTML tags. A webpage typically consists of several HTML element types, such as headings, lists, tables, paragraphs, and form controls.

HTML offers several tags to render these elements, such as the &lt;table> tag to create a table. Each tag indicates how the end DOM elementâ€Š will appear when we use the &lt;table> tag, we know that the web browser will render a table.

Classless CSS frameworks help you style raw HTML pages instantly without using pre-defined classes, like class-based frameworks, or even writing a single line of CSS. Moreover, classless frameworks offer various themes and CSS variables for better customization.
