[LiquidJS](https://liquidjs.com/) is a powerful template language that allows you to dynamically generate content in your web applications. It provides a simple and intuitive syntax for creating dynamic templates.

LiquidJS supports various features such as variables, filters, loops, conditionals, and includes. It is widely used in popular web frameworks like Shopify and Jekyll.

### Safe Rendering
Liquid templates are highly readable and fault-tolerant thus suitable for designers and customers. Operators and expressions are parsed to AST and no eval or new Function are used.

### Zero Dependency
Written with zero npm dependency and no native binding, available in both Node.js and browsers. All of the CMD, ESM and CJS bundles are available on CDN.

### Shopify Compatible
All filters and tags from Ruby shopify/liquid are supported by LiquidJS. Jekyll sites, Github Pages and Shopify templates can be ported to Node.js without pain.

### TypeScript Strict
The whole repo is re-written in TypeScript strict mode to ensure a smooth experience using this lib and the document is precise and always up to date.
